# Adult income prediction
This project uses the UCI Adult dataset to predict whether a person earns more than $50K per year based on demographic
and work-related features such as age, education, occupation, and hours worked per week.
The data was cleaned, preprocessed, and explored to identify important patterns.
Various machine learning models were trained and evaluated, with performance measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
The goal is to provide a reliable classification model that can support data-driven decision-making.
